## Domain Of Interest

- Why are you interested in this field/domain?      
We are all video games lovers. For us, playing video games is such a great way of entertainment. We share a broad interest in playing video games **in different genres**. Rooney likes sports games such as FIFA and 2K; Steven enjoys playing games on the switch; Mila is a big fan of LOL; Lydia loves Pixel style games including Minecraft. During the pandemic, the video game market has seen an unprecedented boom. Staying at home, more and more people flock to the electronic game market, leading to **a rapid increase in their sales**. Therefore, we want to focus our project on **analyzing different genres in video games** as well as **the sales of games**. We expect after the analysis, we can have a better understanding of the video games industry.
